Task: {task_id}

You will produce a unified diff against: {target_file}

Hard rules:
- Output MUST be a unified diff only. No prose.
- Only edit content inside the section headed exactly: {allowed_heading}
- Do not change any other headings or files.

Authoritative skeleton (from Terrain):
{signatures_block}

Current Map block (for reference):
{current_block}

Now output the unified diff.
